# Los-que-quedan
This project addresses the lack of optimization in the urban design of Cuauhtémoc-San Nicolás Avenue, where elements such as poles and vehicles parked on the sidewalks hinder pedestrian mobility and generate risks. Through multi-agent simulations, the aim is to identify solutions such as the elimination of obstacles or the widening of sidewalks, to improve pedestrian flow and safety. The objective is to create a more accessible and safe environment that promotes sustainable urban development in this key area of ​​Monterrey.
